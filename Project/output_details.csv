give it any kind of emotions to it. I have worked with many people who had more experience then me, and have already started to work
under you. If you speak to them they can tell you more about my designs. I am a hard worker, and I will always do my best to get the job
done. I hope this has given you the thought of allowing me to work under you. Hopefully we will have a chance to speak in person next
week. Thank you for your time, and consideration. Sincerely, Ethan Araya Ethan Araya,High School Diploma

This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.Â  The family had
recently hired a new, young general manager.Â  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent
company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.Â 
06/1991 to 09/1994
Owner/Manager Company Name â€“ City , State 
Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference
rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Individual offices were rented to independent business persons by the month, cubicles by the day or hour.Â  All phone calls answered by staff and
messages taken.Â  Secretarial services available to tenants, as well as outside clients, for an hourly fee.Â  Conference rooms available on a daily
or hourly basis.Â  Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside
clients.

Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.Â  I had moved the business once and
paid for build-out of this space.Â  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.
Current
Principal Company Name â€“ City , State 

Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.
Originated and developed creative design concepts.
Assisted clients with budget considerations regarding products and materials.
Successfully resolved complex technical design issues.

Interfaced with architects, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, fabricators, and regulatory agencies.
Specified proper products and materials for each project.
Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.

Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.Â  When business was slow (due to
recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.Â  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.
Transitional Vocation
In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.Â  I was owner of income
properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.Â  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for
drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.Â  Within six months, all units
were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.Â  

In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment
complex.Â  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I
heard while marketing existing floor plans.Â  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a
long waiting list.Â  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely
gratifying.Â  I continued in this position to the end of construction.Â  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a
Residential Property Management Certificate.

My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design. Â

I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.
Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on
their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially,
emotionally, physically, and intellectually.
I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with
tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.
Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.
My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.
Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the
direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.
I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.
Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and
themselves.
Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.
Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the
children.
Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a
great feeling.
Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.
Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.
Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.
Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend
more time in school than any other place.
I believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor
activities during the supporting weather.
I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in
outdoor group activities.
A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy
foods, and less sodium and sugar.
I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.
I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of
cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.
Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school
leaving the parents.
My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.

Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and
themselves.
Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.
Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the
children.
Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a
great feeling.
Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.
Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.
Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.
Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend
more time in school than any other place.
I believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor
activities during the supporting weather.
I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in
outdoor group activities.
A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy
foods, and less sodium and sugar.
I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.
I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of
cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.
Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school
leaving the parents.
My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.

Experience
Director of Information technology Sep 2005 to Current 
Company Name ï¼​ City , State

At Adsystech I am one of three employees that have a key man insurance policy against them.
This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.
I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a
Service (SaaS) product.
I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed
the idea that they should move from "selling" software to "renting" it via an up and coming model SaaS.
Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an
exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring
revenue.
I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies
and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.
As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.
Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of
leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.
I'm very proud of the work I've done and Adsystech, below are some key areas in my control,and Training

Company Name City , State Systems Engineer 02/2006 to 02/2011
I was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product
problems and strengths and collected data on customer experienceÂ  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.Â  The next challengeÂ  came as storage requirements for better performance and
more controlled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local
storage to over 200TB. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the
alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,
purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.Â  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30
minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.
